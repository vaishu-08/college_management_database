#### Student Management: 
Store and retrieve student details such as ID, name, contact information, and date of birth.
#### Library Management:
Maintain records of books, authors, branches, and book issuances.
#### User & Authentication Management:
Store user credentials, roles, and login details for secure access control.
#### Role-Based Access Control: 
Implement different user roles with specific permission levels
